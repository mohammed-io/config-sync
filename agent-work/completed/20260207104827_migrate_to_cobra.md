# Migrate to Cobra CLI

## Status: completed 20260207104934

## Context
Current CLI uses manual switch-based command routing. Cobra provides better UX with auto-generated help, shell completion, and extensible command structure.

## Value Proposition
- Auto-generated --help
- Shell completion (bash/zsh/fish)
- Cleaner command definition
- Industry standard (kubectl, helm, docker-cli use it)

## Alternatives considered
- Keep current approach: Works but manual help, no completion
- urfave/cli: Simpler but less popular than Cobra
- **Cobra (chosen)**: Most popular, battle-tested, rich features

## Todos
- [x] Add cobra dependency
- [x] Create cobra command definitions
- [x] Replace main() switch with cobra.Execute()
- [x] Remove manual printUsage()
- [x] Build and test
